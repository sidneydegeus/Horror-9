This repo only exists for the sake of code reference!
Essentially misses a lot of the assets and thus project wouldn't work if pulled. (Too many, too big files for standard git) 

Original "horror" game made in  Unity 3D. It lacked a lot in the horror department but the project only lasted 6 weeks. Was a 2 man project.
