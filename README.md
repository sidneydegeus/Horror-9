Essentially misses a lot of the assets and thus project wouldn't work if pulled.
Original "horror" game made in  Unity 3D. It lacked a lot in the horror department but the project only lasted 6 weeks. Was a 2 man project.

if I got some time I might see if it's possible to get the whole game here. Previously never attempted it with git LFS before, though from memory the total file size was quite big, so I don't think it would work due to that.
